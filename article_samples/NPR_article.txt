The Fall Of Harriet Miers: A Cautionary Tale For Dr. Ronny Jackson? Miers was White House counsel when President George W. Bush stunned Washington by nominating her to the Supreme Court in October 2005. In 2003, she became deputy chief of staff for policy and, the following year, White House counsel. At that point, the White House announced that Miers had asked to withdraw her nomination â€” just three weeks into the process. But Jackson, like Miers, must face confirmation by the Senate, where initial reaction to his nomination was muted.
