The Kushners Saw Redemption in the White House. It Was a Mirage.

Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are studying whether one of Mr. Kushner’s daughters dangled White House influence before prospective Chinese investors. Jared Kushner’s White House meetings with lenders and partners of Kushner Companies have raised repeated questions about conflicts between his official and personal interests. Most recently, the head of the federal Office of Government Ethics informed a House member in a letter that he had asked the White House counsel to examine meetings in the White House last year between Jared Kushner and officials from two financial companies. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that the counsel’s office was not investigating whether Mr. Kushner broke the law. PhotoOn top of all of this, the political prize at the root of those travails — Jared Kushner’s White House post — appears to be losing its luster.
