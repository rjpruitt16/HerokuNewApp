Trade war escalates as China says it will impose tariffs on 128 U.S. exports, including pork and fruit

China exported $505 billion in goods to the U.S., and U.S. companies exported $135 billion in goods to China in 2017. Trump’s trade approach has been inconsistent, making it difficult for allies and foreign leaders to know what he plans to do. It also appears to be the first country to retaliate to his trade threats, putting pressure on leaders in Washington and Beijing to anticipate each other’s next moves quickly. The stock market rose sharply during Trump’s first year in office, but it has slid back more than 10 percent since late January amid concerns that Trump’s trade threats could roil world markets. His senior advisers, though, say Trump’s trade approach will help U.S. workers by creating more jobs and boosting U.S. exports abroad.
