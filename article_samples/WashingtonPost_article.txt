On Sunday morning, Trump tweeted criticism of Comey, denying some of Comey’s allegations and alleging that Comey revealed classified information and lied to Congress. “Do you think the Russians have something on Donald Trump?” Stephanopoulos asked.

Trump cited the memo in firing Comey, and Comey said he came to believe Rosenstein was “part of the family now. Throughout the interview, Comey stressed the importance of telling the truth, a theme in his book.
