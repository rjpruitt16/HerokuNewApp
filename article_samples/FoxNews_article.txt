The U.S. Coast Guard has rescued a Chinese man off Hawaii who was voyaging from California to Asia in an ocean rowboat. The Coast Guard identifies him as 32-year-old Ruihn Yu, a Chinese national who was rescued Tuesday about 35 miles off the island of Maui. According to the Coast Guard, Yu left California in June and was headed for China and Taiwan when his 18-foot vessel developed communication failures and a damaged rudder. Yu's friend notified the Coast Guard that Yu was in possible distress after receiving a text message from Yu on a two-way satellite communication device. Coast Guard spokeswoman Tara Molle says Yu plans to stay on Maui while a friend sends him parts for repairs.
