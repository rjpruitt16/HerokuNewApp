Senior Project

I created an application that scrapes websites, and plots the sentiment on a graph. My hope is to build a model
for tracking the thoughts and feelings of the world through the news. I am currently rebulding the project to utilize Heroku web server. 

The project utilizes Textblob Natural Language Processing, Postgres Database, Heroku, Django, Redis, Celery Schedulars. 

The project is not finished, but here is a link if you are curious of my progress. https://glacial-taiga-83784.herokuapp.com/
